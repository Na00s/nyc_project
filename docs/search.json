    "text": "1 Introduction\nWe decided to look into employment and labor statistics in New York City as our topic for this project. The reason we chose this topic was, now that we live here, we are likely looking for internships and potentially jobs in the city and we thought it would be interesting to learn more about the employment landscape in New York City and compare that to the rest of the country. That being said, the question we are focused on answering is how do New York City labor statistics differ from the rest of the country? Does that make a compelling arguement to stay and work here? Or should we seek employment elsewhere?\nThese labor statistics that we plan to observe include the unemployment rate, number of employed, the labor force, average hourly earnings, average weekly hours, and average weekly earnings. In order to compare to the rest of the country we will need national averages for all these values as well as to compare with other future working areas some cities we would consider moving to for comparison as well. A long with this, when viewing the average hourly earnings it would be interesting to see how that changes over time compared to inflation, to see where our wages would grow accordingly with inflation.\nFor those that don’t know, labor statistics are commonly created each month nationally, state-wide, and by large city governments. They provide information on changes in the current labor market, i.e. the people in that population who are currently working or looking for a job. With this we commonly find the size of the labor force, the amount of the labor force that is employed, the amount of the labor force that is unemployed, and the unemployment rate. When it comes to those listed as unemployed those are people who have worked in the last year and are currently looking for employment. This means we can gain insight if people are being laid off from their jobs if the labor force remains about the same but the unemployment rate rises. Another great resource the New York State Department of Labor provides is the “State and Area Employment, Hours, and Earnings” which provides us the average hourly earnings, average weekly hours worked, and average weekly earnings which we can use to compare how those in the New York city labor force on average are compensated for their work to the national averages and other cities."

    "text": "2.1 Description\nWith our main questions being how do New York City labor statistics differ from the rest of the country? Does that make a compelling arguement to stay and work here? Or should we seek employment elsewhere? We can answer these questions by comparing the data we have collected above.\nBy first comparing the average New York City working hours to the national average we can get a better idea of whether here in the city we will be working more or less than around the country. This can give us an idea of how our work-life balance may be here compared to the rest of the country and if that is something you prioritize when seeking jobs, depending on the results, you may or may not wish to work here in New York City. We can also compare hourly wage to the national average to see if, for the difference in time worked, you are fairly compensated for your work. This will allow us to better understand if the earnings in New York City are worthwhile or whether it could be beneficially to relocate for better pay. Then with the weekly earnings this sort of provides a holistic picture of the past two examples where we get a better understanding of how much you can actually earn. This is because the hourly wage can be misleading if you work many extra hours whereas this weekly earnings, combined with the hours worked, gives an idea of how well you can expect to be compensated for how much you work. This also all happens to be time series data so we may be able to see trends in the data, for example if the average weekly earnings in New York City has steadily increased over the past years more so than the national average that may mean you could expect you wages to continue to grow more here than somewhere else. With that being said, it will be important to compare these sort of trends by looking into the percent changes over 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years to get a better sense of possible short term and long term trends and expectations.\nNext, the labor force data can give us insight into how easy or hard it may be to find a job. If the unemployment rate is higher here than elsewhere that could be a deterrent for a recent graduate who thinks they may have a better opportunity of securing a job elsewhere. Another way we can view this data is by again looking into the percent changes. For this data we would be more concerned about the short run changes so 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, and 1 and a half years would likely be the scope of our percent changes. These changes can give us an idea if people are getting laid off. The idea being that if the unemployment rate changes but the labor force remains about the same, then that means the change isn’t attributed to people joining the labor force but not having a job, but rather people already in the labor force losing their job. This would mean either people are quiting or getting fired and both are not very good signs for new university grads. This can be compared with national data and if it is starkly different, it may be worthwhile to look elsewhere for work.\nLastly, the employment statistics will provide us a more in depth understanding of whether the indsutries we are interested to work in are hiring or not. This data is very similar to the labor force data however it just provides the total employed and is divided into each industry. This will allow us to see how big each industry is in New York City compared to the rest of the country, if it’s large here it may be best for you to stay, but if only a small fraction of employees for that industry work in New York City compared to the rest of the country it could be worthwhile to move. Then once you decide whether the indsutry you’re interested in has a large enough employee base in New York City, we can use this data to get an idea if these industries are hiring. By using percent change over some likely smaller time frames since we’re interested in more short run current hirings, we can see if the number of employees in a sector has been going up or down and compare this with the national average. The idea being, if the industry has no change or negative change they are laying off employees and it may be hard to work in the industry, but if there are positive changes then they’re hiring. Furthermore, if the percent change is drastically lower than the national average, you’re more likely to work in that industry elsewhere and should consider moving.\nIn the end, we can learn a lot by just comparing the different data to the national averages, but, due to the nature of this time series data, I believe we can learn the most from the trends in each data set. That is why much of our focus will be on the percent changes over certain pre-determined timeframes to give us a better understanding of how each statistic is changing over time."
