    "text": "1 Introduction\nWe decided to look into employment and labor statistics in New York City as our topic for this project. The reason we chose this topic was, now that we live here, we are likely looking for internships and potentially jobs in the city and we thought it would be interesting to learn more about the employment landscape in New York City and compare that to the rest of the country. That being said, the question we are focused on answering is how do New York City labor statistics differ from the rest of the country? Does that make a compelling arguement to stay and work here? Or should we seek employment elsewhere?\nThese labor statistics that we plan to observe include the unemployment rate, number of employed, the labor force, average hourly earnings, average weekly hours, and average weekly earnings. In order to compare to the rest of the country we will need national averages for all these values as well as to compare with other future working areas some cities we would consider moving to for comparison as well. A long with this, when viewing the average hourly earnings it would be interesting to see how that changes over time compared to inflation, to see where our wages would grow accordingly with inflation.\nFor those that don’t know, labor statistics are commonly created each month nationally, state-wide, and by large city governments. They provide information on changes in the current labor market, i.e. the people in that population who are currently working or looking for a job. With this we commonly find the size of the labor force, the amount of the labor force that is employed, the amount of the labor force that is unemployed, and the unemployment rate. When it comes to those listed as unemployed those are people who have worked in the last year and are currently looking for employment. This means we can gain insight if people are being laid off from their jobs if the labor force remains about the same but the unemployment rate rises. Another great resource the New York State Department of Labor provides is the “State and Area Employment, Hours, and Earnings” which provides us the average hourly earnings, average weekly hours worked, and average weekly earnings which we can use to compare how those in the New York city labor force on average are compensated for their work to the national averages and other cities."

    "text": "2.1 Description\nWith our main questions being how do New York City labor statistics differ from the rest of the country? Does that make a compelling arguement to stay and work here? Or should we seek employment elsewhere? We can answer these questions by comparing the data we have collected above.\nBy first comparing the average New York City working hours to the national average we can get a better idea of whether here in the city we will be working more or less than around the country. This can give us an idea of how our work-life balance may be here compared to the rest of the country and if that is something you prioritize when seeking jobs, depending on the results, you may or may not wish to work here in New York City. We can also compare hourly wage to the national average to see if, for the difference in time worked, you are fairly compensated for your work. This will allow us to better understand if the earnings in New York City are worthwhile or whether it could be beneficially to relocate for better pay. Then with the weekly earnings this sort of provides a holistic picture of the past two examples where we get a better understanding of how much you can actually earn. This is because the hourly wage can be misleading if you work many extra hours whereas this weekly earnings, combined with the hours worked, gives an idea of how well you can expect to be compensated for how much you work. This also all happens to be time series data so we may be able to see trends in the data, for example if the average weekly earnings in New York City has steadily increased over the past years more so than the national average that may mean you could expect you wages to continue to grow more here than somewhere else. With that being said, it will be important to compare these sort of trends by looking into the percent changes over 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years to get a better sense of possible short term and long term trends and expectations.\nNext, the labor force data can give us insight into how easy or hard it may be to find a job. If the unemployment rate is higher here than elsewhere that could be a deterrent for a recent graduate who thinks they may have a better opportunity of securing a job elsewhere. Another way we can view this data is by again looking into the percent changes. For this data we would be more concerned about the short run changes so 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, and 1 and a half years would likely be the scope of our percent changes. These changes can give us an idea if people are getting laid off. The idea being that if the unemployment rate changes but the labor force remains about the same, then that means the change isn’t attributed to people joining the labor force but not having a job, but rather people already in the labor force losing their job. This would mean either people are quiting or getting fired and both are not very good signs for new university grads. This can be compared with national data and if it is starkly different, it may be worthwhile to look elsewhere for work.\nThe “Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics” dataset is a highly detailed dataset. It will help up gain valuable insights pertinent to the average salaries and yearly openings of many tech positions that we are interested in (e.g. Data scientists, Statisticians…) across all regions of NY and California, from 2018 till 2022. Several plots included in this project are based on this dataset including plots detailing salary figures’ evolution through time, as well as our interactive plot.\nLastly, the employment statistics will provide us a more in depth understanding of whether the indsutries we are interested to work in are hiring or not. This data is very similar to the labor force data however it just provides the total employed and is divided into each industry. This will allow us to see how big each industry is in New York City compared to the rest of the country, if it’s large here it may be best for you to stay, but if only a small fraction of employees for that industry work in New York City compared to the rest of the country it could be worthwhile to move. Then once you decide whether the indsutry you’re interested in has a large enough employee base in New York City, we can use this data to get an idea if these industries are hiring. By using percent change over some likely smaller time frames since we’re interested in more short run current hirings, we can see if the number of employees in a sector has been going up or down and compare this with the national average. The idea being, if the industry has no change or negative change they are laying off employees and it may be hard to work in the industry, but if there are positive changes then they’re hiring. Furthermore, if the percent change is drastically lower than the national average, you’re more likely to work in that industry elsewhere and should consider moving.\nIn the end, we can learn a lot by just comparing the different data to the national averages, but, due to the nature of this time series data, I believe we can learn the most from the trends in each data set. That is why much of our focus will be on the percent changes over certain pre-determined timeframes to give us a better understanding of how each statistic is changing over time."

Since our analysis isn’t based on these variables, they can simply be dropped as a whole."

However, we can also see that the NYC average is much more volatile with the national average continuously increasing steadily.In recent months it appears that the national average weekly salary is increasing more than NYC as the NYC salary appears to have almost leveled off in the past year.\n\n\n\nCode\nweekly_earnings &lt;- weekly_earnings |&gt;\n  mutate(PercentChange = c(((Value - lag(Value)) / lag(Value)) * 100))\n\nsubsampled_df &lt;- weekly_earnings |&gt; slice(seq(1, n(), by = 2))\n\nsubsampled_df &lt;- na.omit(subsampled_df)\n\n\nggplot(subsampled_df, aes(x = Date, y = PercentChange, color = Location)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Percent Change in NYC vs. National Average Weekly Income Over Time\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Percent Change in Average Weekly Income (%)\")+\n  theme_linedraw()+\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"2 year\", date_labels = \"%b %Y\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we are looking at the percent change over time for both the NYC average weekly salary and the national average weekly salary. This further proves how volatile and seasonal NYC salaries can be. Furthermore, this does show that the national average may be growing faster than the NYC national average over the past few months but this can still be quite hard to read and at first glance looks like currently, NYC salaries are increasing faster than the national average.\n\n\n\nCode\nnyc_weekly_earnings$Difference &lt;- nyc_weekly_earnings$Value - national_weekly_earnings$Value\n\nnyc_weekly_earnings$Date &lt;- as.Date(paste(nyc_weekly_earnings$Year, nyc_weekly_earnings$Month, \"01\", sep = \"-\"), format = \"%Y-%b-%d\")\n\nnyc_weekly_earnings &lt;- na.omit(nyc_weekly_earnings)\n\nggplot(nyc_weekly_earnings, aes(x = Date, y = Difference)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Difference Between NYC and National Average Weekly Earnings Over Time\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Average Weekly Income ($)\")+\n  theme_linedraw()+\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"2 year\", date_labels = \"%b %Y\")+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to further visualize this and get a better understanding of whether the national salary is truly catching up with NYC salaries, we plotted the difference between the NYC and nation average weekly salary. Here you can clearly see there is a current downward trend as it appears the rest of the country is increasing their salaries comparatively to NYC. However, NYC remains having, on average, a weekly salary of a little over $200 more than the rest of the country.\n\n\n\nCode\nNYC_stats &lt;- read.csv(\"data/NYC Employment Statistics.csv\")\n\nNYC_stats &lt;- NYC_stats |&gt; dplyr::select(c(YEAR, INDUSTRY_TITLE, JUN))\n\nNYC_stats &lt;- subset(NYC_stats, INDUSTRY_TITLE %in% c(\"Information\", \"Telecommunications\",\n\"Financial Activities\", \"Financial Investments and Related Activities including Financial Vehicles\", \"Professional and Business Services\", \"Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services\", \"Computer Systems Design and Related Services\", \"Management, Scientific, and Technical Consulting Services\", \"Scientific Research and Development Services\", \"Advertising, Public Relations, and Related Services\", \"Government\"))\n\nNYC_stats$NYC_Values &lt;- NYC_stats$JUN\n\nNYC_stats$Year &lt;- NYC_stats$YEAR\n\nNYC_stats &lt;- NYC_stats |&gt; dplyr::select(-JUN)\n\nNYC_stats &lt;- NYC_stats |&gt; dplyr::select(-YEAR)\n\nNYC_stats &lt;- subset(NYC_stats, Year &gt;= 2013)\n\nNYC_stats$NYC_Values &lt;- as.numeric(NYC_stats$NYC_Values)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntelecoms &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Telecommunications-national.csv\")\nSciRe &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Scientific research and development-national.csv\")\nProSciTech &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Professional,scientific,and technical services-national.csv\")\nProBuss &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Professional and Business Services-national.csv\")\nManSciTech &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Management, scientific, and technical consulting services-national.csv\")\nInfo &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Information(news) - national.csv\")\nGov &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Government-national.csv\")\nFinInv &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Financial Investments-national.csv\")\nFinAct &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Financial Activities-national.csv\")\nCompSys &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Computer systems design and related services-national.csv\")\nAdvert &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Advertising, public relations, and related services-national.csv\")\n\n\ntelecoms$INDUSTRY_TITLE &lt;- \"Telecommunications\"\nSciRe$INDUSTRY_TITLE &lt;- \"Scientific Research and Development Services\"\nProSciTech$INDUSTRY_TITLE &lt;- \"Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services\"\nProBuss$INDUSTRY_TITLE &lt;- \"Professional and Business Services\"\nManSciTech$INDUSTRY_TITLE &lt;- \"Management, Scientific, and Technical Consulting Services\"\nInfo$INDUSTRY_TITLE &lt;- \"Information\"\nGov$INDUSTRY_TITLE &lt;- \"Government\"\nFinInv$INDUSTRY_TITLE &lt;- \"Financial Investments and Related Activities including Financial Vehicles\"\nFinAct$INDUSTRY_TITLE &lt;- \"Financial Activities\"\nCompSys$INDUSTRY_TITLE &lt;- \"Computer Systems Design and Related Services\"\nAdvert$INDUSTRY_TITLE &lt;- \"Advertising, Public Relations, and Related Services\"\n\n\nnational_stats &lt;- rbind(telecoms, SciRe, ProSciTech, ProBuss, ManSciTech, Info, Gov, FinInv,\n                        FinAct, CompSys, Advert)\n\nnational_stats &lt;- national_stats |&gt; dplyr::select(c(Year, INDUSTRY_TITLE, Jun))\n\nnational_stats &lt;- pivot_longer(national_stats, cols = -c(Year, INDUSTRY_TITLE), names_to = \"Month\", values_to = \"National_Values\")\n\nnational_stats &lt;- national_stats |&gt; dplyr::select(-Month)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nNYC_stats_wide &lt;- spread(NYC_stats, key = Year, value = NYC_Values)\n\nnational_stats_wide &lt;- spread(national_stats, key = Year, value = National_Values)\n\nNYC_stats_wide$Location &lt;- \"New York City\"\n\nnational_stats_wide$Location &lt;- \"National\"\n\nnational_stats_wide$\"2018\" &lt;- (national_stats_wide$\"2018\" / 162210) * 100\nNYC_stats_wide$\"2018\" &lt;- (NYC_stats_wide$\"2018\" / 4262.878) * 100\nnational_stats_wide$\"2019\" &lt;- (national_stats_wide$\"2019\" / 163073) * 100\nNYC_stats_wide$\"2019\" &lt;- (NYC_stats_wide$\"2019\" / 4261.786) * 100\nnational_stats_wide$\"2020\" &lt;- (national_stats_wide$\"2020\" / 159900) * 100\nNYC_stats_wide$\"2020\" &lt;- (NYC_stats_wide$\"2020\" / 4061.283) * 100\nnational_stats_wide$\"2021\" &lt;- (national_stats_wide$\"2021\" / 161192) * 100\nNYC_stats_wide$\"2021\" &lt;- (NYC_stats_wide$\"2021\" / 4116.222) * 100\nnational_stats_wide$\"2022\" &lt;- (national_stats_wide$\"2022\" / 164002) * 100\nNYC_stats_wide$\"2022\" &lt;- (NYC_stats_wide$\"2022\" / 4099.68) * 100\nnational_stats_wide$\"2023\" &lt;- (national_stats_wide$\"2023\" / 166951) * 100\nNYC_stats_wide$\"2023\" &lt;- (NYC_stats_wide$\"2023\" / 4184.884) * 100\n\nstats &lt;- rbind(NYC_stats_wide, national_stats_wide)\n\nggparcoord(NYC_stats_wide, columns = c(7:12), groupColumn = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Potential Industries Labor Force Share in NYC\", \n         x = \"Years\", \n         y = \"Potential Industries Labor Force Share in %\", \n         color = \"Industry\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows the percent share of the labor force each potential industry that might hire a data scientist has in NYC over time. This shows, working in scientific research and even computer systems is not a very large portion of the NYC labor forces. This means if you’re interested in these sectors you may find larger companies elsewhere. But we believe the biggest takeaway from this graph is an idea on the most prevalent industries in NYC, mainly Business services. In other words, Business services have a large employee base here and if we wish to work in that sector, NYC may be our best option. Furthermore, when we see an increase in the percentage of the labor force over time, that means those industries are hiring, so along with being the largest proportion, business services companies are also hiring.\n\n\n\nCode\nggparcoord(stats, columns = c(7:12), groupColumn = 13, title = ) + \n  labs(title = \"Comparing NYC Potential Industries Labor Force Percent\\nShare vs. National\", \n         x = \"Years\", \n         y = \"Potential Industries Labor Force Percent Share in %\", \n         color = \"Scope\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we are comparing the same industries percent share of the labor force in NYC against their share of the labor force in the United States. This gives us an idea if there are industries that are larger than average or smaller than average. When reading this, you can see many of the blue lines are about the same if not above the red lines, giving us an indication that many of the industries we chose are either average size compared nationally or above average size, making an argument that NYC is a good location to be hired in these industries as they employ a large amount of the labor force comparatively to national averages."

One of the important criteria we consider when it comes to choosing a career path is compensation. With “Data Scientist” being on the top of our lists, this graph gave us an idea of what an average data scientist should expect as a salary in NY in 2022. In comparison to the set of observed tech jobs, we see that data science positions’ salaries lay almost in the middle. So while an average data scientist’s salary is around 40k USD above the average salary in NY (“All Positions”), and around 30k USD above an average Web Developer’s salary, it is still less than the average salary for a Software Developer. Out of the list, the average salary for a Research Scientist is the highest, which is expected considering the selectivity of such positions.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Parallel axis plot for the Mean Annual Salary for Tech Jobs across NY State 2019-2022\n\nfocus_occupations = c(\"Data Scientists\" , \"Computer Programmers\" , \"Statisticians\" , \"Software Developers\", \"Database Administrators and Architects\", \"Computer and Information Research Scientists\", \"Software Quality Assurance Analysts and Testers\" )\n\nall_data_NY[all_data_NY$OCC_TITLE %in% focus_occupations,] |&gt;\n  group_by(YEAR, OCC_TITLE) |&gt; summarise(Mean_Annual_Salary = mean(A_MEAN , na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(names_from = YEAR, values_from = Mean_Annual_Salary) |&gt;\n  ggparcoord(\n    columns = 3:6, groupColumn = 1,  scale = \"globalminmax\", missing = \"mean\",\n    ) +   \n      labs(title = \"The Mean Annual Salary for Tech Jobs across NY State,\\n2019-2022 \", \n         x = \"Years\", \n         y = \"Mean Annual Income in $\", \n         color = \"Occupation\")\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'YEAR'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing the progress of the mean annual salary for a data scientist in comparison to a set of tech jobs, we notice that it took the sharpest dive between 2019 and 2022. While the mean annual salary for a statistician or a software developer grew consistently year-over-year over the 3 years period, the average salary for a data scientist took a dive between 2019 and 2020 and remained almost stagnant between 2020 and 2022.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Parallel axis plot for the Mean Annual Salary for DATA Scientists and Software Developers in Different Regions of NY, 2019-2022\nall_data_NY[all_data_NY$OCC_TITLE %in% c(\"Data Scientists\", \"Software Developers\"),] |&gt;\n  group_by(YEAR, AREA_TITLE, OCC_TITLE) |&gt; summarise(Mean_Annual_Salary = mean(A_MEAN)) |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(names_from = YEAR, values_from = Mean_Annual_Salary) |&gt;\n  \n  ggparcoord(\n    columns = 4:7, groupColumn = 2, showPoints = TRUE,  scale = \"globalminmax\"\n    ) + labs(title = \"The Mean Annual Salary for DATA Scientists and Software Developers\\nin Different Regions of NY, 2019-2022 \", \n        x = \"Years\", \n        y = \"Mean Annual Income in $\", \n        color = \"Occupation\")\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'YEAR', 'AREA_TITLE'. You can override\nusing the `.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we focused on two occupations out of the bunch: “Data Scientists” and “Software Developers”, and detailed their mean annual salaries figures into mean annual salaries per region of the state of NY, we would notice a contradictory trend to what we saw in the previous plot. For data science positions, only two regions of the state of NY have recorded consistent figures relating to the occupation’s mean annual salary. Therefore, we can attribute the acute drop in the mean average salary that we noticed in the previous plot to data inconsistencies. When observing this plot, we see that the mean annual salary for a data scientist is actually growing over the 3 years period, following a similar trend to “Software Developers” (although the latter appears to have a higher rate of growth)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In our pursuit of an ideal career path and a suitable location to seek employment, we first looked at NYC and compared its employment climate with the rest of the country. We then expanded our scope to include the state of NY and its different regions, comparing average salaries across a set of tech jobs that we are interested in. This was supplemented with an analysis of data science, statistics, and software engineering employment figures across a period of 4 years in those regions. On the one hand, these figures helped us form an idea about which specific occupations we may want to pursue (based on compensation figures); on the other hand, they gave us an insight into which regions in the state of NY have a growing tech market and an increasing number of data scientist openings year-over-year. The scope of this analysis was further expanded to include another tech hub in the US, which is California. We looked at San Francisco as another tempting destination. We compared average yearly salaries figures for a set of tech jobs (e.g. Data Scientist, Statistician, Researcher…) in SF, NY and including national averages as a point of reference. What we noticed is that in general, salaries in SF tend to be higher than in NY for the same occupations; However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that SF is a better option to seek employment. To get a holistic perspective, which could be considered as a potential extension/future step to this project, we can look at other factors such as cost of living, happiness indexes…\nThe main challenges we faced in this project relate to data sources. Acquiring, preprocessing and compiling the datasets took the lion’s share of the overall time spent on the project. There were also some inconsistencies across the datasets. For example, we found out that “Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics” datasets have slight variations from year to year. Specifically, some columns are missing in a few datasets and some categories’ names vary from dataset to dataset. Therefore, we had to manually match a few of them to ensure consistency across the board.\nApart from gaining valuable insights into the tech job market, one valuable lesson we learned is how important data is in making rational decisions. That is, with proper data exploratory techniques, we can eliminate many options that may cloud our judgement and form educated opinions."
